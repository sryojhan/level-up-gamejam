  - Oh man... Oh man...
  - Do you happen to know anything about what happened in the kitchen??!
  - Sorry. I'm just a little bit nervious....
  - I haven't seen my brother Socky in about 3 days. All since the 'Washing Machine
    Incident'
  - You seem like a brave adventurer, will you lend me a hand?
  - To defeat the Washing Machine, you will need to look for the three 'Laundry baskets' 
    all around the house. It will be hard, but I know I can count on you. You watch
    out for the dirty clothes and eveything will be alright
  - Good luck
